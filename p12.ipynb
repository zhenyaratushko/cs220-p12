    "You **may not** hardcode indices in your code. You **may not** manually download **any** files for this project, unless you are **explicitly** told to do so. For all other files, you **must** use the `download` function to download the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer. If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required Functions:\n",
    "- `download`\n",
    "- `parse_html`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required Data Structures:\n",
    "- `institutions_df`\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you are also **required** to follow the requirements below:\n",
    "* **Avoid using loops to iterate over pandas dataframes and instead use boolean indexing.**\n",
    "* Do **not** use `loc` to look up data in **DataFrames** or **Series**. You are **allowed** to use `iloc`.\n",
    "* Do **not** use **absolute** paths such as `C://ms//cs220//p12`. You may **only** use **relative paths**.\n",
    "* Do **not** use meaningless names for variables or functions (e.g. `uuu = \"my name\"`).\n",
    "* Do **not** leave irrelevant output or test code that we didn't ask for.\n",
    "* Do **not** write the exact same code in multiple places. Instead, wrap this code into a function and call that function whenever the code should be used.\n",
    "* Do **not** call unnecessary functions.\n",
    "* **Avoid** calling **slow** functions multiple times within a loop.\n",
    "* **Avoid** inappropriate use of data structures. For instance: do **not** use a `for` loop to search for a corresponding value in a dictionary with a given key; instead use `dictname[key]` directly.\n",
    "* Do **not** define multiple functions with the same name or define multiple versions of one function with different names. Just keep the best version.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In a **DataFrame**, to find the **number** of times each unique value in a column repeats, you can use the `DataFrame.value_counts` method. For example,\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "rankings[\"Country\"].value_counts()\n",
    "```\n",
    "would output a `pandas` **Series** with the **indices** being the unique values of `Country` and the **values** being the **number** of times each country has featured in the `rankings` **DataFrame**. You can find the documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.value_counts.html). You can adapt this code to find the number of institutions from each country that features in the `Year` *2020-2021*.\n",
    "2. Just like with **DataFrames**, you can use Boolean indexing on **Series**. For example, try something like this in a separate cell below:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = pd.Series([100, 200, 300])\n",
    "a[a > 100]\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. You can extract the **indices** of a **Series**, `s` with `s.index`."
